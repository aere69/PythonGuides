# Leap Year (Beginner)

Write a program that returns True or False whether if a given year is a leap year.

A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.

## Leap year conditions

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

- on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder

- except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder.

- unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder.

i.e. 2000 is a Leap year, 2100 is not a Leap year
