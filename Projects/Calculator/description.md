# Calculator (Beginner)

The goal is to build a calculator program.

Use a dictionary that references each of the mathematical calculations that can be performed by our calculator.

## Functionality

+ Program asks the user to type the first number.
+ Program asks the user to type a mathematical operator (a choice of "+", "-", "*" or "/")
+ Program asks the user to type the second number.
+ Program works out the result based on the chosen mathematical operator.
+ Program asks if the user wants to continue working with the previous result.
If yes, program loops to use the previous result as the first number and then repeats the calculation process.
If no, program asks the user for the fist number again and wipes all memory of previous calculations.
