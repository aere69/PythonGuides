# Prime Numbers (Beginner)

Prime numbers are numbers that can only be cleanly divided by themselves and 1.

Write a function that checks whether a number is a prime number or not. (It should return True or False.)

Use that function to write a program that lists all prime numbers between 1 and a given number.

## Examples

+ 7 is a primer number because it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
+ 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.

**NOTE:** 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and itself, but 1 is not a prime number because it is only divisible by 1.
